## My Journey: 

Passing the CompTIA Security+ exam was a significant accomplishment in my cybersecurity journey. By closely following the exam objectives and leveraging key tools, I was able to deepen my understanding of critical concepts and techniques.
To further enhance my preparation, I used tools like SIEMs, Splunk, Wireshark, and SQL, and studied frameworks like NIST. These tools and concepts helped solidify my understanding of real-world cybersecurity practices, which played a pivotal role in passing the exam. I am now equipped with the necessary skills and knowledge to pursue a career as a SOC analyst, confident in my ability to secure and protect information systems.
